        <h1 id="text1" class="text">"The Moment I Fell for You Again"</h1>
        <p id="text2" class="textb">The first time I saw you, I already felt myself falling in love, but I was too shy to say it. I felt a bit awkward because of our friend group, but when the two of us went to a concert, even though we didn’t really spend much time together and I made you wait for a while because of friends, it was still unforgettable. That day rekindled my feelings for you, and it was also the first real conversation we’d had in a long time. That moment boosted my confidence to finally tell you how I feel.

        <h1 id="text3" class="text">"My Greatest Adventure: Loving You" </h1>
        <p id="text4" class="textb">After I confessed my feelings to you and told you, "liligawan kita," I knew in my heart that I was willing to risk anything for us to be happy and together. Even though I'm shy and sometimes struggle to keep a long conversation going over chat, I still tried because, well, "ikaw na yan, e." Talking to you feels like playing an adventure game—it’s fun, exciting, and full of surprises. And honestly, I’d spend as much time as it takes to figure out every little detail, just to know you better.</p>

        <h1 id="text5" class="text">Sana mag ka usap ule tayo</h1>
        <p id="text6" class="textb">Over time, I found myself genuinely enjoying our conversations, but I also started to feel drained. It wasn’t because of you; it was because I felt like I was always the one reaching out. If I didn’t start the conversation, it felt like we wouldn’t talk at all. I’m not upset with you—I’m more frustrated with myself. I wish I could entertain you as effortlessly as others do, or as I do with my own friends.</p>
